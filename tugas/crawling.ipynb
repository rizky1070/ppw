      "Abstract: Context: Systems of Systems (SoS) constitute a type of complex software systems resulting from integrating heterogeneous constituent systems that are independently operable on their own but are networked together for a common goal. Each constituent system has its own purpose and could operate and collaborate voluntarily with other constituent systems to achieve a common goal that cannot be treated by any of them in isolation. Objective: A constituent system may be deployed or undeployed at run-time within an SoS. Emergent behaviors may be undesirable and affect the behaviors of each constituent system and lead to unexpected operations and a lack of permanent status in the SoS. Thus, we need to continuously extract and represent the actual behaviors within the SoS at run-time. Method: In this paper, we implement the first step our “Architecture Mining” approach. Thus, we monitor an SoS and develop Discovery algorithm to extract the actual behaviors. The actual behaviors are presented by a “Discovered Model” dynamically and automatically built from the execution traces. Results: To implement our approach, we applied it to a case study entitled Smart City, which is an SoS including six types of constituent systems. We extracted the actual behaviors executed at run time from the SoS execution traces, which have never been modeled in any constituent system nor expected by the designer.\n",

      "Abstract: Machine learning methods play an important role in creating algorithms for data analysis in the mining industry. These methods allow you to train the system based on historical data and identify hidden patterns that may not be obvious in traditional analysis. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict breakdowns, optimize production processes and identify anomalies in the operation of machinery. For example, with the help of training on data on the operation of equipment, you can create a model that will predict the probability of failure of a certain part under specified operating conditions.\n",

      "Abstract: Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’).

      "Abstract: Web traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing network resources, enhancing user experience, and ensuring efficient server load management. Traditional approaches, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning methods like support vector machines and decision trees, focus primarily on temporal data. These models, however, often fail to capture the intricate relationships within web traffic data, such as user interactions or page-to-page connections, resulting in sub-optimal predictive performance. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) address these limitations by modeling web traffic as a graph, where web pages or users are represented as nodes, and their interactions form edges. GCNs aggregate node information through graph structures, enabling the model to learn both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in web traffic. This ability to exploit complex data relationships makes GCNs well-suited for more accurate and dynamic web traffic predictions. In this work, we propose a GCN-based framework for web traffic forecasting, incorporating multiple optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and SGD to identify the model’s fair performance. By optimizing training through these methods, the GCN model efficiently captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in web traffic patterns. Our study highlights the potential of GCNs in elevating the accuracy and reliability of web traffic forecasting. The integration of advanced optimizers further enhances convergence and prediction efficiency, offering a more scalable solution to meet the demands of rapidly growing and complex web systems.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper is associated with a tutorial presented at DEXA 2025 Conferences and Workshops. The tutorial shares the practical experience gained from a 3-year R&D project for a big financial institution in Poland. The project aimed at developing deduplication pipelines for customer records. It involved the development of two distinct end-to-end deduplication pipelines that are based on (1) statistical/probabilistic modeling and on (2) machine learning. This tutorial focuses on lessons learned from developing the machine learning pipeline , within the context of a real-world industrial setting. Moreover, this tutorial provides an overview of approaches to data deduplication, including the traditional state-of-the-art baseline deduplication pipeline, solutions based on machine learning and neural networks that apply pre-trained and large language models.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper is devoted to optimizing the processes of work using intellectual control systems for the transportation and grinding of ore in gold mining fields. Ore is being optimized through the introduction of modern technologies and information systems in the transportation and grinding processes in order to increase efficiency, reduce energy consumption and reduce production costs. The paper examines the applications of IoT technologies, artificial intelligence, and large-scale data analysis in ore transport and grinding processes. With these systems, there is talk of monitoring processes in real time and improving the efficiency of equipment operation. New methods for managing ore transport and grinding processes through mathematical models, optimization algorithms and artificial neural networks are also presented. The results of scientific research in this paper can contribute to innovations and technological developments in the field of gold mining. Improving efficiency through automation of gold mining processes and intellectual management systems not only contributes to economic benefits, but also to the protection of the environment.\n",

      "Abstract: Understanding user navigation patterns from clickstream data is crucial for improving business software, yet remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis.\n",

      "Abstract: Understanding user navigation patterns from clickstream data is crucial for improving business software, yet remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis.\n",

      "Title: Analyzing Water Consumption Patterns in Mexico City: A GIS and Data Science Approach\n",
      "Abstract: Water scarcity in Mexico City has become an increasingly urgent issue, exacerbated by inefficient and unequal consumption patterns across its urban fabric. This study advances Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research by developing and applying an integrative spatial analysis framework specifically tailored to the complexities of urban water management. Beyond its application to Mexico City, the research demonstrates how GIS can be used to fuse heterogeneous datasets, including those from SACMEX (Mexico City’s Water System), INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography), and DENUE (National Directory of Economic Units), into a unified analytical environment. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), spatial data mining, and clustering techniques, the study identifies critical disparities in water consumption at multiple spatial scales, from boroughs to neighborhoods. A key contribution is the implementation of a layered system architecture for managing historic spatiotemporal data, enabling dynamic visualization of consumption patterns. The findings reveal that socio-economic and demographic variables play a decisive role in shaping spatial water demand, with marginalized communities facing disproportionate challenges. While previous spatiotemporal analyses of water consumption in Mexico City have primarily focused on aggregated borough-level data or isolated socio-demographic correlations, they have often lacked multiscale integration, high-resolution neighborhood-level analysis, or interactive visualization tools to support policy development. This research addresses these limitations by providing a fine-grained, multilayered analytical approach that enhances the scientific understanding of urban water use. Beyond offering immediate policy-relevant insights for Mexico City, the methodological framework proposed here contributes to GIS research by providing a scalable, transferable approach for analyzing urban resource consumption patterns. Future work will focus on incorporating real-time data streams, expanding sector-specific analysis, and integrating additional variables and domains required for a comprehensive understanding of water dynamics. This study represents a first step toward building an adaptive, equitable, and efficient urban water management strategy.\n",

      "Abstract: As society develops, mental health is becoming increasingly important. Traditional mental health assessment methods, such as face-to-face interviews and observational techniques, are limited by several factors, including subjectivity, response delays, and high costs. To address these issues, recent research has utilized smart sensor data. Using smartphones to collect data provides valuable insights into student behavior while ensuring the privacy of the individuals involved. The transition from traditional questionnaires to sensor data has prompted the adoption of a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for a more comprehensive classification of mental health. This study investigates the relationship between behavioral attributes and mental health dimensions, using the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and feature extraction. This method uncovers significant correlations, highlighting the close connection between mental health and behavioral data through detailed analysis. The study proposes the use of multi-task modeling to optimize information utilization and identify correlations across tasks. The introduction of the Deep Cross Network with Squeeze and Excitation Network and Progressive Layered Extraction (DC-SE-PLE), a deep learning neural network model, enhances hierarchical feature extraction and cross-task learning, significantly improving the model’s generalization and prediction accuracy.\n",

      "Abstract: For the past 20 years, web tracking has raised worries among privacy advocates and authorities responsible for data protection. Researchers have proposed several machine learning-driven remedies to identify Web trackers in an automated manner. While those have displayed potential, they have primarily remained as proofs-of-concept. This work extends on t.ex-Graph outlined in our previous work [ 36 ]. The aim of this model is to distinguish benign from tracking hosts by considering their centrality in the network, and data flows to them. Based on the results of our previous work, we abandoned the SLD-based approach. Consequently, we made slight modifications to the feature vector. Our classifier’s performance is comparable to its original version, and we tested its cross-browser and longitudinal performance. Our results indicate that while the cross-browser performance significantly decreases, the longitudinal performance maintains a high level.\n",

      "Abstract: As cloud services shift from monolithic architectures to microservices, post-failure fault and anomaly detection becomes increasingly challenging due to cascading effects across interdependent services and the overwhelming volume of heterogeneous logs and metrics. We propose FNoDe (Faulty Node Detection), a framework that integrates application logs, performance metrics, and distributed traces into a unified graph structure to detect both the root cause and type of anomaly. By leveraging a graph convolutional network (GCN), FNoDe learns system representations under normal and anomalous states from historical microservice data and uses these embeddings to classify new system states. Evaluated on five public benchmarks and two in-house microservice systems, FNoDe outperforms traditional methods by 20–30% in accuracy and maintains competitive performance with state-of-the-art frameworks, while also offering interpretability through XAI techniques.\n",

      "Abstract: The application of deep learning (DL) models in agriculture has witnessed significant growth, particularly in the early detection and management of plant diseases. This research focuses on exploring temporal analysis within DL architectures to predict plant disease outbreaks, aiming to enhance proactive interventions. This study aims to assess the efficacy of various DL models, including InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB7, VGG19, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, in predicting plant disease outbreaks. By analyzing their performance metrics, we seek to understand their predictive capabilities and potential for enhancing agricultural disease management. A suite of state-of-the-art DL models is employed to analyze temporal data and predict plant disease outbreaks. Performance metrics, including accuracy, are evaluated to gauge the effectiveness of each model. The integration of temporal data enables the models to forecast disease outbreaks by identifying patterns and trends over time. Our findings showcase diverse accuracies across the DL models tested. Notably, the EfficientNetB7 model demonstrates remarkable accuracy approaching perfection, while others, such as MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3, exhibit room for improvement. The integration of temporal analysis empowers these models to forecast disease outbreaks proactively, representing a paradigm shift in agricultural disease management. This research highlights the transformative potential of integrating temporal analysis with DL models in predicting and managing plant diseases. By moving from reactive measures to proactive, predictive interventions, we can ensure sustainable and robust crop yields in the face of evolving agricultural challenges.

      "Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the predominant cause of mortality globally, surpassing both diabetes and cancer. Reducing illness and mortality rates requires the prompt identification and accurate prediction of CVDs. Diagnostic techniques such as coronary angiography are very precise but also invasive, costly, and cause discomfort. There is a need for diagnostic approaches that are reliable and do not require intrusive procedures. Machine learning (ML) and data mining play a crucial role in healthcare, particularly in the identification of heart problems. ML algorithms can accurately predict cardiac disease by analyzing clinical data, aiding in clinical decision-making. This comprehensive study provides a concise overview of the latest developments in ML and DL techniques for the detection, classification, and prediction of CVDs. The assessment assesses Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Decision Trees. The evaluation is based on data from trustworthy sources spanning from 2014 to 2024. The report additionally delineates the main obstacles encountered by researchers, examines potential remedies, and proposes future investigations to augment heart disease prediction systems.

      "Abstract: Acute ischemic stroke is a critical medical emergency caused by a sudden loss of blood flow to the brain, leading to brain cell death due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. While Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is instrumental in diagnosing ischemic stroke, current practices primarily rely on the manual assessment of DWI images to delineate the ischemic core, a time-intensive and subjective process that introduces variability in clinical decisions regarding endovascular treatments. This study aims to address these limitations by evaluating artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for automated DWI analysis, focusing on their potential to enhance stroke outcome prediction accuracy and consistency. Using a systematic review methodology, we examine AI applications that automatically identify stroke-affected areas in DWI scans and compare key approaches in terms of their performance metrics. Our findings indicate that AI methodologies can improve the speed and precision of stroke assessments, suggesting that these technologies have significant implications for advancing diagnostic consistency and aiding clinical decision-making in stroke care.\n",

      "Abstract: In the era of digital transformation, network optimization has an important role in ensuring efficient, reliable, and scalable communication systems. The rise of 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing increases complexity of networks and as a result traditional optimization methods struggle to meet the growing demand for speed, security, and resource efficiency. To mitigate this complexity, Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance network performance by enabling intelligent decision-making, predictive analytics, and real-time adaptation to dynamic conditions. To improve various aspects such as traffic management, resource allocation, fault detection, and security, machine Learning in network optimization leverages advanced algorithms. By analyzing vast amounts of network data, ML techniques can identify patterns, predict congestion, automate configurations, and optimize routing strategies with minimal human intervention. These capabilities lead to reduced latency, enhanced Quality of Service (QoS), and better utilization of network resources.

      "Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly machine learning (ML)-based solutions, become increasingly prevalent in the automotive sector, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment is critical. ISO23894 [ 1 ] provides essential guidelines for risk management in AI systems, helping organizations mitigate potential hazards associated with these technologies. However, the automotive industry requires more specific frameworks to address the unique challenges of integrating machine learning into safety-critical systems from both process and product perspectives. This paper [ 15 ] presents a new, comprehensive risk management process designed for machine learning applications in automotive systems, building on the principles of ISO23894 while aligning with the new requirements introduced by A-SPICE (Automotive SPICE) Process Assessment Model (PAM) version 4.0 for machine learning. The proposed process incorporates AI-specific risk mitigation strategies and integrates them into the existing automotive software and systems development lifecycle, focusing on aspects such as model explainability, validation, traceability, and continuous monitoring. By aligning ISO23894’s guidance with the updated A-SPICE PAM V4.0, this paper provides a robust framework to improve the safety, performance, and compliance of ML-driven automotive systems, and provides and improvement proposal to the A-SPICE for machine learning as a reference.\n",

      "Abstract: Smart farming harnesses machine learning (ML) algorithms to optimize crop production by providing tailored recommendations based on various factors such as crop selection, seasonality, and field dimensions. This paper explores the development and implementation of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression with Principal Component Analysis (LR with PCA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), as well as Soft and Hard Voting classifiers, to assist farmers in predicting crop yield using user-provided inputs. By integrating historical data, climate patterns, and soil conditions, these models offer accurate predictions for crop yields, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and maximize their agricultural output. The use of machine learning in agriculture is revolutionizing traditional farming practices. Farmers are increasingly turning to data-driven approaches to enhance productivity and efficiency. By applying advanced algorithms, they can better understand complex variables influencing crop growth and outcomes. This includes factors such as temperature fluctuations, rainfall patterns, and soil health. Models like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines excel in handling these multidimensional datasets and extracting insights that lead to actionable outcomes for farmers. In addition, ensemble methods like Soft and Hard Voting classifiers further improve prediction accuracy by combining the strengths of individual models. The inclusion of Logistic Regression with PCA aids in dimensionality reduction, ensuring that the most relevant features are considered during prediction. Ultimately, the integration of machine learning in smart farming enhances the precision of crop management, resulting in increased yields, reduced waste, and more sustainable agricultural practices. This paper contributes to the growing body of research on the practical applications of machine learning in modern agriculture.\n",
