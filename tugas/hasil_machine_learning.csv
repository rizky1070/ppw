This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis.

10.1007/s00376-025-4520-8,A Deep Learning–Based Bias Correction Model for Tropical Cyclone Track and Intensity towards Forecasting of the TianXing Large Weather Model,"Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) tracks and intensities is essential. Although the TianXing large weather model, a six-hourly forecasting model surpassing operational forecasts, exhibits superior performance, its TC forecasts still require enhancement. Prediction errors persist due to biases in the training data and smoothing effects in data-driven methods. To address this, we introduce CycloneBCNet, a deep-learning model designed to correct TianXing’s TC forecast biases by leveraging spatial and temporal data. CycloneBCNet utilizes the SimVP (simpler yet better video prediction) framework with spatial attention to highlight cyclone core regions in forecast fields. It also incorporates TC trend information (center position, maximum wind speed, and minimum sea level pressure) via an LSTM (long short-term memory) module. These TC vectors are derived from post-processed TianXing forecasts. By fusing features from forecast fields and TC vectors, CycloneBCNet corrects biases across multiple lead times. At a 96-h lead time, the track error reduces from 162.4 to 86.4 km, the wind speed error from 17.2 to 6.69 m s^−1, and the pressure error from 22.2 to 9.36 hPa. Interpretability analysis shows that CycloneBCNet adjusts its attention across forecast lead times. Intensity corrections prioritize inner-core dynamics, particularly the eye and eyewall, while track corrections shift from lower-level variables and the cyclone’s core to broader environmental factors and mid- to upper-level features as the forecast duration increases. These findings demonstrate that CycloneBCNet effectively captures key TC dynamics consistent with meteorological principles, including the dominance of near-surface conditions for intensity and the increasing influence of steering currents on track prediction. 准确预报热带气旋 (TC) 的路径与强度至关重要。 尽管逐 6 小时预报的天行气象大模型整体性能优于业务数值模式, 其 TC 预报仍受训练数据偏差与数据驱动方法固有平滑效应的共同影响而存在系统性误差。 为此, 本文提出 CycloneBCNet: 一种面向天行预报的双流偏差订正模型。 该模型基于 SimVP 提取预报场的时空演变特征, 并通过空间注意力权重机制突出气旋核心区; 同时以 LSTM 从 TC 演变向量 (中心位置、最大风速、最低海平面气压) 中提取趋势信息, 二者在多时效维度进行特征融合以进行偏差订正。 结果表明, 在 96 h 时效下, 路径误差由 162.4 km 降至 86.4 km, 最大风速误差由 17.2 m s^−1 降至 6.69 m s^−1, 最低海平面气压误差由 22.2 hPa 降至 9.36 hPa。 可解释性分析进一步显示, 强度订正优先关注内核动力过程 (眼区与眼墙), 而路径订正的注意力随时效延长由核心区与近地面要素转向更大尺度环境场及中高层引导气流。 上述结果与气象机理一致, 表明 CycloneBCNet 能够有效捕获关键 TC 动力学特征并实现物理一致的偏差订正。",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00376-025-4520-8

Current osteoporosis management focuses on elderly fracture prevention, but many are unaware of their condition until a fracture occurs. This framework seeks to enable earlier diagnosis and management for all individuals, preventing fractures and improving quality of life, especially for at-risk and aging populations. These interesting findings prove modern deep learning systems as potential diagnoses for bone fractures even in cases of ones suffering from osteoporosis.

10.1007/s44174-025-00378-2,"Python and Photoplethysmogram-Based Signal Processing Technique for Heart Rate Estimation, HRV Analysis and Other Relevant Processing of ECG and PPG Signals","The Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is commonly used to determine Heart Rate (HR) and analyze Heart Rate Variability (HRV). It has been widely used in recent research to detect many psychological and physical problems. More new and advanced programming-based signal processing techniques are needed to be developed to analyze PPG signals more precisely and with added advanced features.

The need for more accessible and effective methods of identifying managing diagnosing and treating retinal disorders has been brought to light by recent research. When designing a computer-aided diagnosis tool for diabetic retinopathy, it is crucial to evaluate both challenges of achieving a reliable early diagnosis at an affordable cost and effectiveness of screening programs. Biomedical engineers and computer scientists now have innovative ways to meet the demands of clinical practice thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning techniques. The primary objective of this study is to develop a methodology for classifying the severity of diabetic retinopathy that integrates pre-processing, segmentation, and severity classification.

10.1007/s44174-025-00345-x,Improving Lung Cancer Diagnosis Using the Distributed Zero Attention Enabled Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network,"Respiratory cancer, the second prevalent contributor to cancer-related fatalities, necessitates timely diagnosis for improved patient outcomes. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to the current approaches, such as computational complexity, limited robustness, data loss, and problems with data availability. To mitigate the drawbacks of the previous approaches, this research presents the Distributed Attention-Based Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (DisAPCN) model to achieve effective lung cancer detection. The proposed approach incorporates the Zero attention-based U-Net (ZU-Net) for segmenting the affected regions of the lungs. The ZU-Net effectively upgrades the ability of the model to attain precision outcomes with the reduction of numerous parameters that lead to minimizing the resources and time. Further, the deepened network of DisAPCN enables the model to diminish its computation at each layer and its size results in a pyramidical shape. Specifically, the DisAPCN model effectively captures the features of varied scales with progressive downsampling which enhances the training capability. Furthermore, the edge features along with the pre-trained models mitigate the vanishing gradient problems as well as enhance the framework’s detection performance. The evaluation findings reveal the dominance of DisAPCN model methods achieving a 95.52% F1 score, 95.40% precision, and 95.64% recall which is improved over the other traditional methods.
