      "Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, poses significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide due to its increasing prevalence and need for early detection to improve patient outcomes. This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.\n",

      "Abstract: Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is a bioderived and biodegradable thermoplastic widely used in various applications; however, its brittleness limits its mechanical performance. To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.\n",

      "Abstract: Underwater cultural heritage (UCH) is integral to both cultural heritage and natural heritage, thus making it a shared Ocean Heritage . The stories of our societies and our ancestors are wrapped in intangible connections with the ocean and preserved on the seafloor as artefacts, shipwrecks, and remains of those lost or buried at sea. Deep sea mining (DSM) threatens this Ocean Heritage and has the potential to destroy crucial pieces of our past and disrupt our deep cultural connections to the ocean. This book is designed to highlight the potential threat of DSM, covered here mostly in international waters and as regulated by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), and make ocean professionals across many different fields aware of those dangers and of the work is being done to help mitigate the possible launch of DSM operations. It does not aim to be the final word on the issue but rather start a discussion and encourage scientists and cultural leaders to engage and work together.\n",

We consider some of the major breakthroughs about constraint-based data mining and several nice results about interesting pattern set discovery. We then focus on recent approaches for a cross-fertilization between pattern discovery and neural-based Machine Learning approaches. Specifically, neural methods have been developed for pattern mining and pattern set mining, enabling more efficient exploration of structural motifs in complex datasets. Additionally, hybrid approaches integrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have emerged, aiming to enhance the interpretability and transparency of machine learning models.

Although the DATALOG project, presented as a case study, is focused on the development of the implementation of data mining to identify patterns and generate early warnings, the developed infrastructure and architecture are designed to integrate future Machine Learning (ML) implementations. Initially, Machine Learning techniques and methods that could be applied in this context are addressed, such as the prediction of adverse clinical events and the automatic classification of medical data, exploring their potential in preventive diagnosis and home hospitalization. Finally, the system architecture, monitored variables, and experimental results are described, showing how IoMT and data mining can improve the accuracy of the monitoring and contribute to a preventive and proactive care model.\n",

      "Abstract: Cultural connectivity has been a marker of Oceania since time immemorial. Islands were fished out of the water by ancestral demi-gods; sea routes were mapped and shared with kindred animals; currents, winds, and stars were felt, breathed in, and drawn in sand and in minds. Sharks, dolphins, and turtles are still called today across different islands Place names are shared across vast expanses and ancient sacred complexes unite communities from different corners of Oceania. Deep sea mining (DSM) threatens this long standing connectivity, compounding the already serious impacts of climate change which are damaging the ocean and islands.\n",

      "Abstract: Power laws play a crucial role in understanding the structural and functional properties of real-world graphs, influencing various aspects of graph mining and query processing. This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.\n",

      "Abstract: Process mining is an advanced technological field offering transformative solutions for data-driven process analysis, and in this context, digital forensics for databases emerges as an increasingly important domain benefiting from process mining techniques in modern digital forensic investigations. However, detecting suspicious transactions remains a challenging task due to the complexity and scale of financial processes, as well as the adaptive nature of fraudulent behaviors. Traditionally, database examinations have relied on manual reviews and specific queries, which are time-consuming and may overlook hidden patterns. Existing methods in the literature often struggle with scalability, lack of automation, and limited ability to capture process deviations effectively. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic method of advanced data analytics combining process mining principles exists in this field. This work presents a novel approach that integrates multiple process mining techniques, including process discovery and conformance checking, to model business processes and systematically identify deviations associated with suspicious activities. The experimental results depict the ability of the proposed approach to detect the suspicious transactions and fraudulent activities.\n",

      "Abstract: Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.\n",

      "Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in academia and industry due to their ability to comprehend natural language and generate content to perform various tasks. Numerous studies suggested that service-oriented computing (SOC), a key computing paradigm for building distributed enterprise applications, can benefit from LLMs. We observed that SOC researchers are increasingly applying LLMs to tasks such as service composition, service code generation, and service monitoring. However, no study systematically reviews these research efforts and delineates research challenges. To fill this research gap, this study presents a systematic literature review of 64 papers published on LLMs for SOC tasks between January 2019 and February 2025. We aimed to analyze and summarize the relevant studies and formulate a research roadmap to provide a context for shaping ongoing research activities. We categorized our findings into four SOC domains: service foundation, service composition, monitoring and management, and design and development.\n",

      "Abstract: This survey paper covers about three decades of research on pattern discovery. We consider some of the major breakthroughs about constraint-based data mining and several nice results about interesting pattern set discovery. We then focus on recent approaches for a cross-fertilization between pattern discovery and neural-based Machine Learning approaches. Specifically, neural methods have been developed for pattern mining and pattern set mining, enabling more efficient exploration of structural motifs in complex datasets. Additionally, hybrid approaches integrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have emerged, aiming to enhance the interpretability and transparency of machine learning models. We finally illustrate to what extent our colleague Arno Siebes has contributed to the considered topics.\n",

      "Abstract: To understand blockchain and distributed ledger solutions, one should also understand the underlying technologies and concepts that make up, or at least have influenced, the creation of blockchain technology. Only that way we can hope to understand how the idea of Bitcoin and blockchain saw the light of day. You can simply pass through this section, but you will see that if you are willing to take the time to understand what underlying principles have helped to define blockchain, it will give you an edge once we start to dive deeper into blockchain itself.\n",

      "Abstract: From all cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks, Bitcoin was the first and arguably to this day the most famous of them all. It was the first coin that based itself not on a banking system, a centralized government and/or a payment system but is in fact completely decentralized. The network is completely trustless and trust is based on the actions of all the nodes in the network. Consensus is needed to move forward and is the lifeblood of the network. Bitcoin is also the proponent of what is currently called ‘blockchain 1.0’ or the first type of blockchain and blockchain implementation to see the light of day. Within the network the proof of work algorithm is being used, more specifically it is based on the secure hash algorithm 256, better known as SHA-256 (see earlier for detailed explanation)\n",

      "Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, poses significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide due to its increasing prevalence and need for early detection to improve patient outcomes. This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.\n",

      "Abstract: Diabetes is a major chronic disease categorized by elevating the range of sugar levels in blood cells, and early detection is crucial in reducing the risks and severity associated with the condition. Various machine learning (ML) schemes are developed to forecast the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. Classical systems lacked a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) using Deep Learning (DL) to predict varying diabetes levels and support clinical decisions. Therefore, a novel hybrid optimization technique Fossa Green Anaconda Optimization_Deep Kronecker Network (FGAO_DKN) is proposed for the efficient prediction of diabetes. FGAO_DKN is the amalgamation of Fossa Optimization Algorithm (FOA) and Green Anaconda Optimization (GAO) for improved feature selection and model training. The data are initially transformed using the Yeo–Johnson method. Afterward, feature selection is conducted by means of Fossa Green Anaconda Optimization (FGAO). Thereafter, data augmentation is performed with a Bootstrapping scheme. Finally, diabetes prediction is attained based on the Deep Kronecker Network (DKN). Moreover, DKN is trained with FGAO. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that the FGAO_DKN attained an increased level of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity as 98.29%, 96.39%, and 98.59%, respectively. Thus, FGAO_DKN method offers a promising tool for healthcare professionals to make better decisions, certainly reducing the risks and severity of diabetes through timely intervention.\n",

      "Abstract: Heart Disease (HD) significantly impacts global health, making its accurate prediction critical for reducing death rates. This paper proposes a novel optimization-based HD prediction system leveraging metaheuristic algorithms. Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) is employed for optimal feature selection due to its efficiency in high-dimensional datasets, faster convergence, and reduced risk of overfitting, while Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizes the weights of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for its computational efficiency and robust global optimization capabilities. The proposed method is evaluated on the Cleveland and Statlog datasets using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. It achieves 92.45% and 91.51% accuracy for the Cleveland and Statlog datasets, respectively, outperforming existing optimization techniques. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms other feature and weight optimization techniques, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing HD diagnosis. Graphical Abstract \n",

      "Abstract: Medical imaging is critical in detecting and managing infections, with X-ray imaging being a cornerstone in this domain. This review provides an overview of X-ray imaging principles, including the basic mechanisms underlying X-ray absorption and image formation. Emerging trends in X-ray imaging for detecting various infections, such as respiratory infections, bone and joint infections, fungal infections, and viral infections, are discussed in detail. Some advantages of X-ray imaging over other imaging techniques for infection detection are highlighted, along with recent technological advancements in X-ray imaging techniques. Key topics covered include film-screen radiography, computed radiography, flat-panel detector-based radiography, and the evolution of thin-film transistor array-based digital radiography. Additionally, the principles of direct and indirect conversion X-ray detectors are explored, along with primary physical parameters of X-ray imaging such as spatial resolution, contrast, noise, modulation transfer function (MTF), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Furthermore, the application of computed tomography (CT) and 3D radiography in infection detection and the role of X-ray microscopy are discussed. Clinical implications of X-ray imaging in infection detection are elaborated, including its role in early detection and diagnosis, assessment of disease progression, identification of complications, guidance for interventional procedures, and screening in high-risk populations. Recommendations for optimizing X-ray imaging in clinical practice for infection detection and suggestions for future research directions are provided.

      "Abstract: This research aims to develop a CNN-based computational framework for diagnosing bone fractures from X-rays, improving osteoporosis knowledge. Current osteoporosis management focuses on elderly fracture prevention, but many are unaware of their condition until a fracture occurs. This framework seeks to enable earlier diagnosis and management for all individuals, preventing fractures and improving quality of life, especially for at-risk and aging populations. These interesting findings prove modern deep learning systems as potential diagnoses for bone fractures even in cases of ones suffering from osteoporosis. This paper examines the use of DEXA radiography augmented by deep learning algorithms to estimate fracture risk beyond mineral density determination. The existence of computer-aided designs in numerous areas cuts across and helps to address the issues that are presented with the current methods of diagnosis. In the field of bone radiography, X-ray has been opted for in this study since it is more effective than CT scans. In this research, an advanced CNN model was applied that included a mix of architectural modifications to classical models and data augmentation techniques to outperform other standard CNN-based models. The Canny edge detection algorithm and the contour detection algorithm, both based on OpenCV, were incorporated and supplemented using Adam optimization. The focus of this work has been the enhancement of CNN model to detect fractures and localize it at the same time. The best model solely attained an accuracy level of 98.23%, outperforming all other tested models, including VGG16, VGG19, Random Forest Classifier, ViT’s, and its various versions.\n",

      "Abstract: The Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is commonly used to determine Heart Rate (HR) and analyze Heart Rate Variability (HRV). It has been widely used in recent research to detect many psychological and physical problems. More new and advanced programming-based signal processing techniques are needed to be developed to analyze PPG signals more precisely and with added advanced features. This paper presented Python and pulse sensor-based, a low-cost technique for PPG signal analysis. In the PPG signals, the peaks were detected using the Peakutils library. The time differences of consecutive peaks were estimated to estimate the HR and analyze the HRV. The HR was estimated using three different methods. Peakutils library has successfully detected the peaks in the signals. The results obtained by the three methods were almost the same. The HRV was analyzed very comfortably in two different terms. Signal processing has been given a lot of focus in this technique, and it has produced good results. It will help in developing new devices (including IoT-based) and other advanced research on signal analysis, such as advanced investigation of P, Q, R, S, and T waves in the ECG signals and analysis of HRV of psychological and cardiac problematic patients.\n",

      "Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy most common preventable cause of vision impairment primarily affects people in their working years worldwide. The need for more accessible and effective methods of identifying managing diagnosing and treating retinal disorders has been brought to light by recent research. When designing a computer-aided diagnosis tool for diabetic retinopathy, it is crucial to evaluate both challenges of achieving a reliable early diagnosis at an affordable cost and effectiveness of screening programs. Biomedical engineers and computer scientists now have innovative ways to meet the demands of clinical practice thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning techniques. The primary objective of this study is to develop a methodology for classifying the severity of diabetic retinopathy that integrates pre-processing, segmentation, and severity classification. For pre-processing, it is recommended to use median filtering, followed by segmentation with Gradient Descent—Sea Turtle Foraging Algorithm-based SwinUNet (GD-STFA-based SwinUNet). The diabetic retinopathy severity is then classified through the proposed ensemble learning using Xception,MoNet andPolyNet. Diabetic retinopathy cases are thus classified into five severity levels by proposed ensemble learning: No Diabetic Retinopathy, Mild Diabetic Retinopathy, Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy, Severe Diabetic Retinopathyand Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. Experimental outcomes are compared with standard models and the proposed ensemble learning (MoNetPolyNetXception) technique outperforms them with 98.9% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 98.5% specificity, and 98.4% precision rate.\n",

      "Abstract: Respiratory cancer, the second prevalent contributor to cancer-related fatalities, necessitates timely diagnosis for improved patient outcomes. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to the current approaches, such as computational complexity, limited robustness, data loss, and problems with data availability. To mitigate the drawbacks of the previous approaches, this research presents the Distributed Attention-Based Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (DisAPCN) model to achieve effective lung cancer detection. The proposed approach incorporates the Zero attention-based U-Net (ZU-Net) for segmenting the affected regions of the lungs. The ZU-Net effectively upgrades the ability of the model to attain precision outcomes with the reduction of numerous parameters that lead to minimizing the resources and time. Further, the deepened network of DisAPCN enables the model to diminish its computation at each layer and its size results in a pyramidical shape. Specifically, the DisAPCN model effectively captures the features of varied scales with progressive downsampling which enhances the training capability. Furthermore, the edge features along with the pre-trained models mitigate the vanishing gradient problems as well as enhance the framework’s detection performance. The evaluation findings reveal the dominance of DisAPCN model methods achieving a 95.52% F1 score, 95.40% precision, and 95.64% recall which is improved over the other traditional methods.

      "Abstract: Brain tumor detection using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for early diagnosis, but conventional methods often struggle with accuracy and real-time performance. This work introduces a novel cloud-supported Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework for efficient brain tumor classification. The proposed model, named Zeiler–Fergus Memory-Boosted Dilated Progressive Feedback Residual Attention Network with Dung Beetle Optimizer (ZFMBDPFRANet-DBO) integrates a Memory-Boosted Twin Guidance Filtering (MBTGF) mechanism to enhance MRI quality, followed by feature extraction using a Zeiler and Fergus Residual Network (ZFNet-DRN). A Dilated Progressive Feedback Residual Attention Network (DCPFRANet) is employed for classification, and optimization is carried out using the Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO). Testing out BraTS 2020 data set has an exceptional result of accuracy: 99.97% on normal, 99.84 percent on glioma, 99.60 percent on pituitary, and 99.87% on meningioma. The sensitivity and specificity are above 99%, the system has minimal delay (10.34 ms) and high throughput (1250 kbps), which is a key feature applicable in remote e-health cases. This architecture provides a scalable, performance-oriented framework to permit real-time diagnosis of brain tumor in healthcare systems equipped with IoMT.\n",
