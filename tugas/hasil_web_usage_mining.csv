This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00279-4

10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2,Development of Toughened Poly (lactic acid) by Melt Blending with Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) Using Epoxidized Castor Oil as a Compatibilizer for Biomedical Applications,"Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is a bioderived and biodegradable thermoplastic widely used in various applications; however, its brittleness limits its mechanical performance. To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2
10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6,‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment,"Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6
10.1007/978-981-96-6250-0_33,"A Comparative Study on Association Rule Mining Algorithms Like Apriori, Fp-Growth, ECLAT, Enhanced Apriori, and Rapid Association Rule Mining","Association rule mining (ARM) is a technique within data analysis that focuses on identifying frequent patterns or itemsets from datasets. Several algorithms, such as Apriori and FP-Growth, have been developed to perform this task. In this paper, we explore a selection of well-established ARM algorithms, including Apriori, Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth), Equivalence Class Clustering with a bottom-up Lattice Traversal (ECLAT), Rapid Association Rule Mining (RARM), and Enhanced Apriori. These algorithms represent both classic and modern approaches in ARM, offering a diverse spectrum of methodologies for frequent pattern extraction. This study aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of these algorithms on a real-world dataset of varying sizes. We utilize the online retail dataset from the UCI machine learning repository dividing it into four subsets for analysis. Each algorithm is tested on these subsets, and its performance is evaluated using several criteria, such as execution time, memory consumption, quality of generated rules, and the total number of rules produced. Furthermore, we assess the impact of different support thresholds on the quantity and quality of rules generated to provide a thorough comparison across all scenarios. The results show that Enhanced Apriori reduced execution time by 48% and memory consumption by 43% compared to Apriori. FP-Growth showed 43% faster execution time for small datasets and 63% faster performance for larger datasets, while consuming 45% less memory on small datasets and 50% less memory on larger datasets. Additionally, ECLAT performed 62% faster on small datasets and 47% faster on larger datasets, with 57% and 53% lower memory consumption, respectively. These findings highlight significant efficiency improvements in both runtime and memory usage, especially for larger datasets, and provide valuable insights into selecting algorithms based on dataset characteristics and ARM application requirements.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-6250-0_33

10.1007/978-3-032-07336-5_14,Process Mining for Databases Forensic Investigations: Detecting Suspicious Transactions,"Process mining is an advanced technological field offering transformative solutions for data-driven process analysis, and in this context, digital forensics for databases emerges as an increasingly important domain benefiting from process mining techniques in modern digital forensic investigations. However, detecting suspicious transactions remains a challenging task due to the complexity and scale of financial processes, as well as the adaptive nature of fraudulent behaviors. Traditionally, database examinations have relied on manual reviews and specific queries, which are time-consuming and may overlook hidden patterns. Existing methods in the literature often struggle with scalability, lack of automation, and limited ability to capture process deviations effectively. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic method of advanced data analytics combining process mining principles exists in this field. This work presents a novel approach that integrates multiple process mining techniques, including process discovery and conformance checking, to model business processes and systematically identify deviations associated with suspicious activities. The experimental results depict the ability of the proposed approach to detect the suspicious transactions and fraudulent activities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-07336-5_14
