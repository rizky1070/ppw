This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00279-4
10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2,Development of Toughened Poly (lactic acid) by Melt Blending with Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) Using Epoxidized Castor Oil as a Compatibilizer for Biomedical Applications,"Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is a bioderived and biodegradable thermoplastic widely used in various applications; however, its brittleness limits its mechanical performance. To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2
10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6,‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment,"Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6

10.1007/978-3-032-07336-5_14,Process Mining for Databases Forensic Investigations: Detecting Suspicious Transactions,"Process mining is an advanced technological field offering transformative solutions for data-driven process analysis, and in this context, digital forensics for databases emerges as an increasingly important domain benefiting from process mining techniques in modern digital forensic investigations. However, detecting suspicious transactions remains a challenging task due to the complexity and scale of financial processes, as well as the adaptive nature of fraudulent behaviors. Traditionally, database examinations have relied on manual reviews and specific queries, which are time-consuming and may overlook hidden patterns. Existing methods in the literature often struggle with scalability, lack of automation, and limited ability to capture process deviations effectively. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic method of advanced data analytics combining process mining principles exists in this field. This work presents a novel approach that integrates multiple process mining techniques, including process discovery and conformance checking, to model business processes and systematically identify deviations associated with suspicious activities. The experimental results depict the ability of the proposed approach to detect the suspicious transactions and fraudulent activities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-07336-5_14

Numerous studies suggested that service-oriented computing (SOC), a key computing paradigm for building distributed enterprise applications, can benefit from LLMs. We observed that SOC researchers are increasingly applying LLMs to tasks such as service composition, service code generation, and service monitoring. However, no study systematically reviews these research efforts and delineates research challenges. To fill this research gap, this study presents a systematic literature review of 64 papers published on LLMs for SOC tasks between January 2019 and February 2025. We aimed to analyze and summarize the relevant studies and formulate a research roadmap to provide a context for shaping ongoing research activities. We categorized our findings into four SOC domains: service foundation, service composition, monitoring and management, and design and development.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-07313-6_6

10.1007/978-3-032-00979-1_3,Bitcoin,"From all cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks, Bitcoin was the first and arguably to this day the most famous of them all. It was the first coin that based itself not on a banking system, a centralized government and/or a payment system but is in fact completely decentralized. The network is completely trustless and trust is based on the actions of all the nodes in the network. Consensus is needed to move forward and is the lifeblood of the network. Bitcoin is also the proponent of what is currently called ‘blockchain 1.0’ or the first type of blockchain and blockchain implementation to see the light of day. Within the network the proof of work algorithm is being used, more specifically it is based on the secure hash algorithm 256, better known as SHA-256 (see earlier for detailed explanation)",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-00979-1_3
