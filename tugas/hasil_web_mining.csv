This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00279-4
10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2,Development of Toughened Poly (lactic acid) by Melt Blending with Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) Using Epoxidized Castor Oil as a Compatibilizer for Biomedical Applications,"Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is a bioderived and biodegradable thermoplastic widely used in various applications; however, its brittleness limits its mechanical performance. To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2
10.1007/978-3-031-98238-5_1,Introduction,"Underwater cultural heritage (UCH) is integral to both cultural heritage and natural heritage, thus making it a shared Ocean Heritage . The stories of our societies and our ancestors are wrapped in intangible connections with the ocean and preserved on the seafloor as artefacts, shipwrecks, and remains of those lost or buried at sea. Deep sea mining (DSM) threatens this Ocean Heritage and has the potential to destroy crucial pieces of our past and disrupt our deep cultural connections to the ocean. This book is designed to highlight the potential threat of DSM, covered here mostly in international waters and as regulated by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), and make ocean professionals across many different fields aware of those dangers and of the work is being done to help mitigate the possible launch of DSM operations. It does not aim to be the final word on the issue but rather start a discussion and encourage scientists and cultural leaders to engage and work together.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-98238-5_1

10.1007/978-3-032-08324-1_4,Bridging the Interpretability Gap in Process Mining: A Comprehensive Approach Combining Explainable Clustering and Generative AI,"Process mining often yields highly complex “Spaghetti Models”, making them difficult to interpret and impeding informed decision-making. Therefore, researchers have explored clustering of event logs to simplify process models and reduce their complexity. However, the unsupervised nature of clustering can introduce an interpretation gap, necessitating manual effort to identify differences and similarities across the resulting process models. To address these issues, we propose an explainable clustering approach that identifies key subprocesses and applies eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to clarify the rationale behind model partitioning. Moreover, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) into the process discovery procedure to generate natural language descriptions and compare the discovered process models, enhancing user understanding, engagement, and making complex technical details more accessible. A case study demonstrates that our method operates effectively across various LLMs, preserving vital contextual information while simplifying the process discovery workflow. Our findings reveal that larger models generally ensure completeness, whereas smaller ones offer more efficiency at the expense of explanation quality, highlighting the importance of a balanced LLM choice for practical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-08324-1_4

10.1007/978-3-031-98238-5_8,Moana Matters: Culture and Deep Sea Mining in Oceania,"Cultural connectivity has been a marker of Oceania since time immemorial. Islands were fished out of the water by ancestral demi-gods; sea routes were mapped and shared with kindred animals; currents, winds, and stars were felt, breathed in, and drawn in sand and in minds. Sharks, dolphins, and turtles are still called today across different islands Place names are shared across vast expanses and ancient sacred complexes unite communities from different corners of Oceania. Deep sea mining (DSM) threatens this long standing connectivity, compounding the already serious impacts of climate change which are damaging the ocean and islands.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-98238-5_8

This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_7
