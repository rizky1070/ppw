This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00279-4

To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2
10.1007/978-3-031-98238-5_1,Introduction,"Underwater cultural heritage (UCH) is integral to both cultural heritage and natural heritage, thus making it a shared Ocean Heritage . The stories of our societies and our ancestors are wrapped in intangible connections with the ocean and preserved on the seafloor as artefacts, shipwrecks, and remains of those lost or buried at sea. Deep sea mining (DSM) threatens this Ocean Heritage and has the potential to destroy crucial pieces of our past and disrupt our deep cultural connections to the ocean. This book is designed to highlight the potential threat of DSM, covered here mostly in international waters and as regulated by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), and make ocean professionals across many different fields aware of those dangers and of the work is being done to help mitigate the possible launch of DSM operations. It does not aim to be the final word on the issue but rather start a discussion and encourage scientists and cultural leaders to engage and work together.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-98238-5_1

Islands were fished out of the water by ancestral demi-gods; sea routes were mapped and shared with kindred animals; currents, winds, and stars were felt, breathed in, and drawn in sand and in minds. Sharks, dolphins, and turtles are still called today across different islands Place names are shared across vast expanses and ancient sacred complexes unite communities from different corners of Oceania. Deep sea mining (DSM) threatens this long standing connectivity, compounding the already serious impacts of climate change which are damaging the ocean and islands.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-98238-5_8

This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_7
10.1007/978-3-032-07336-5_14,Process Mining for Databases Forensic Investigations: Detecting Suspicious Transactions,"Process mining is an advanced technological field offering transformative solutions for data-driven process analysis, and in this context, digital forensics for databases emerges as an increasingly important domain benefiting from process mining techniques in modern digital forensic investigations. However, detecting suspicious transactions remains a challenging task due to the complexity and scale of financial processes, as well as the adaptive nature of fraudulent behaviors. Traditionally, database examinations have relied on manual reviews and specific queries, which are time-consuming and may overlook hidden patterns. Existing methods in the literature often struggle with scalability, lack of automation, and limited ability to capture process deviations effectively. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic method of advanced data analytics combining process mining principles exists in this field. This work presents a novel approach that integrates multiple process mining techniques, including process discovery and conformance checking, to model business processes and systematically identify deviations associated with suspicious activities. The experimental results depict the ability of the proposed approach to detect the suspicious transactions and fraudulent activities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-07336-5_14
